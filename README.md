# Home.ly
LA Hacks 2015

Home.ly is a lazy way of interacting with your SmartThings! Using Myo.js and endpoints located within SmartApps for SmartThings,
we were able to develop a stable working interaction between the Myo armband and the SmartThings, all in Javascript/jQuery for the local webpage and Groovy to define endpoint functionality in the SmartApp API.
